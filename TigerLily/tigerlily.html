 Wikipedia was just a dream.
October 2: Readers in the United States deserve an explanation.
Please don't skip this 1-minute read. It's Thursday, October 2, and we're running a short fundraiser to support Wikipedia. If you've lost count of how many times you've visited Wikipedia this year, we hope that means it's given you at least $2.75 of knowledge. Please join the 2% of readers who give what they can to keep this valuable resource ad-free and available for all.

25 years ago Wikipedia was a dream. A wildly ambitious, probably impossible dream. A dream that came together piece by piece. Now, 65 million articles. 260,000 volunteers across the entire world. Here's to 25 years of knowledge, humanity, and collaboration at its best.

Most readers donate because Wikipedia is useful to them, others because they realize knowledge needs humans. If you feel the same, please donate $2.75 now—or consider a monthly gift to help all year. Thank you.

 Wikipedia was just a dream.
October 2: Readers in the United States deserve an explanation.
Please don't skip this 1-minute read. It's Thursday, October 2, and we're running a short fundraiser to support Wikipedia. If you've lost count of how many times you've visited Wikipedia this year, we hope that means it's given you at least $2.75 of knowledge. Please join the 2% of readers who give what they can to keep this valuable resource ad-free and available for all.

25 years ago Wikipedia was a dream. A wildly ambitious, probably impossible dream. A dream that came together piece by piece. Now, 65 million articles. 260,000 volunteers across the entire world. Here's to 25 years of knowledge, humanity, and collaboration at its best.

Most readers donate because Wikipedia is useful to them, others because they realize knowledge needs humans. If you feel the same, please donate $2.75 now—or consider a monthly gift to help all year. Thank you.
